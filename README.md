## Run in local

Run in these commands at the root of the repository to start the project:

Only the first time you run the project:  
`yarn`Â   
`docker-compose up -d`  
`cp ./packages/api/.env.example ./packages/api/.env`  
`cp ./packages/server/.env.example ./packages/server/.env`  
`yarn api cmd build`  
`yarn api cmd migration:run`  
`yarn api cmd db:seed`  
`yarn start`

Every time you want to run the project:  
`yarn start`
